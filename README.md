# Upcoming Soccer Matches App

A web app to display real upcoming soccer matches.

## About This Project
This project was created for a web development assignment. The goal was to fetch and display a list of upcoming soccer matches using a public API, and to practice both backend and frontend skills. I learned a lot about working with APIs, Node.js, and organizing code for clarity!

## Features
- Lists real upcoming soccer matches (teams and date/time)
- Modern, responsive UI with custom colors and fonts
- Node.js/Express backend fetches data from the API
- Clean separation of frontend and backend code
- Error handling and loading states

## API Used
- [Football-Data.org](https://api.football-data.org/v4/matches)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PoonamChaudhary272/upcoming-matches.git
   cd upcoming-matches
   ```
2. Go to the backend folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Add your API key to a `.env` file in the backend folder:
   ```
   FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## What I Learned
- How to fetch and display live data from a real sports API
- How to use Node.js and Express to build a backend
- How to organize a project with separate frontend and backend folders
- How to make a web app look modern and user-friendly
